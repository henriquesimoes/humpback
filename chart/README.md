# Charts

Charts created to be included in reports using a JavaScript library.

## How to render charts

In order to render the charts you must need to have a localhost configured in your machine. If you have `Python` installed in your machine, you can create a simple HTTP server with the following command.

```bash
$ sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Note that this will open the server communication on port 80. You may change the port if there is any conflict with another installed apps.

Now, you just need to open the browser and type `localhost:80/main.html`. And the browser will load the HTML page, the needed data and create the charts.
