# Experiments and training steps

This is the list of training steps and experiments done for analyzing the second place solution.

## Training step logs

### ResNet-101

Training procedure logs for each type of training involving ResNet-101.

- [256x512 - pseudo labels](./resnet101.pseudo.256x512.log) - This was the first training performed. It target training using image size 256x512 and pseudo labeled data. For the complete log, including the model structure, see the [screen log](/screen-resnet101.pseudo.256x512.log).

- [256x512](./resnet.256x512.log) - Training using the image size 256x512 without pseudo labels. It was used a batch size of 64.
